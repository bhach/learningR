Handling Duplicate Data:
========================

Duplicated Rows:
================
Rule:duplicated rows are not necessarily incorrect

It's not uncommon to find duplicated rows in a dataset.
This is definitely a situation that requires further investigation when it occurs.

There may be a perfectly valid reason to have the same row appear twice in your dataset.

You shouldn't simply assume that any duplicated values are erroneous and need to be removed.

The important thing to remember is that a dataset in R is not the same as a database table that follows the normal forms.
While a database table should have a primary key that helps distinguish rows, there is no such requirement for a unique identifier in an R dataset.

Treatment for Identical Rows:
-----------------------------
If the investigation determines that they really are unwanted duplicates, then you can proceed to get rid of them, and you have two options for removing them.
if they truly are completely identical, you can use R's unique function to get rid of them.
However, if the rows are not 100% identical, the unique function won't remove them.
You'll need to manually remove whichever row you believe is incorrect.

unique()
duplicated()
distinct()

Treatment for Overlapping Rows:
-------------------------------
Remove duplicates but not identical ones by filtering incorrect values.
