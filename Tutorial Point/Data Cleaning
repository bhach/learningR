Data Cleaning:
==============

Detecting Outliers:
-------------------
Outliers are data points distant from others.
They may indicate an error in the dataset or form a new pattern.


Missing data:
=============
Real data are likely to contain missing values.
There are three basic approaches to dealing with missing data.
1. feature selection
2. listwise deletion
3. imputation
Let’s see how each applies to the msleep dataset from the ggplot2 package.
The msleep dataset describes the sleep habits of mammals and contains missing values on several variables.

1. Feature selection:
----------------------
In feature selection, you delete variables (columns) that contain too many missing values.

#Find the proportion of missing data
pctmiss <- colSums(is.na(msleep))/nrow(msleep)

Sixty-one percent of the sleep_cycle values are missing. You may decide to drop it.

2. Listwise selection:
----------------------
Listwise deletion involves deleting observations (rows) that contain missing values on any of the variables of interest.

newdata <- select(msleep, genus, vore, conservation)
newdata <- na.omit(newdata)

3. Imputation:
--------------
Imputation involves replacing missing values with “reasonable” guesses about what the values would have been if they had not been missing.
There are several approaches, as detailed in such packages as VIM, mice, Amelia and missForest.
Here we will use the kNN function from the VIM package to replace missing values with imputed values.

# Impute missing values using the 5 nearest neighbors
library(VIM)
newdata <- kNN(msleep, k=5)

Basically, for each case with a missing value, the k most similar cases not having a missing value are selected.
If the missing value is numeric, the mean of those k cases is used as the imputed value.
If the missing value is categorical, the most frequent value from the k cases is used.
The process iterates over cases and variables until the results converge (become stable).
This is a bit of an oversimplification - see Imputation with R Package VIM for the actual details.

Important caveate: Missing values can bias the results of studies (sometimes severely).
If you have a significant amount of missing data, it is probably a good idea to consult a statistician or data scientist before deleting cases or imputing missing values.
