attach & detach:
================
Attach is used to access the variables present in the data framework without calling the data frame.
Detach is used to detach the variables present in the data framework.

For example, u have imported the dataset "Mini"
attach(Mini)    #Run this code to attach and start using function on direct variables in the dataframe and no need to call the dataframe everytime.

It can be done in case of multiple data frameworks also. but it might be a problem if same variable names in multiple data frameworks.



subset():

#select all columns except desig whose sal is greater than 60000
subset(emp, sal > 60000, select = -desig)

#employees who joined on or after 2013
subset(emp, as.Date(doj) > as.Date("2013-01-01"))
recent_join <- subset(emp, as.Date(doj) > as.Date("2013-01-01"))
